# Deep CNNs for Palm Fruit Maturity Classification

A deep learning-based classification method for **palm fruit maturity** using **CNN models**, including **ResNet50** and **InceptionV3**. This project leverages **transfer learning** with fine-tuning to classify palm fruit bunches into five maturity stages: **unripe, under-ripe, medium-ripe, ripe, and over-ripe**.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Deep CNN models**: Baseline CNN, ResNet50, and InceptionV3
- **Transfer learning** with pre-trained models
- **Dataset preprocessing** and augmentation
- **Evaluation metrics**: Accuracy, AUC, F1-score, ROC curves, and confusion matrices

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset was obtained from [**IEEE DataPort**](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/date-fruit-dataset-automated-harvesting-and-visual-yield-estimation) and consists of images captured in **natural orchard environments**. The dataset was split into **80% training and 20% testing**.
